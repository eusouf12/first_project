                       <h1 id="b-title">ICC Men's<br/> World Cup, 2023</h1> 
                       <p id="des">The 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup is the 13th edition of the Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament is being hosted by India. It started on 5 October and is scheduled to conclude on 19 November 2023. England were the defending champions, having won the 2019 edition by defeating New Zealand in the final.<br/><br/>Like the previous World Cup, the tournament will feature 10 teams. The main route for qualification was, however, through the new ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, a series of matches played between 2020 and 2023 rather than the ODI rankings.[13] The top eight of the 13 sides in the Super League qualified for the World Cup automatically, although as hosts India, who finished fourth, were guaranteed a place. In June and July 2023, the bottom five teams from the Super League and the top five ranked associate sides competed in the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier for the remaining two places.</p>

                     <br/>
                     <p>That's it! Bangladesh have done it. They beat Sri Lanka by three wickets in Match 38. Bangladesh register their highest-ever successful run-chase against Sri Lanka, hunt down the target of 280 with 53 balls to spare. Riding on a terrific 169-run stand between skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh pull off an impressive win. A win for Bangladesh after 6 straight defeats. Second win in the competition for Shakib and co. This is now the 6th loss for Kusal Mendis and co. in this year's tournament which means they are now officially out of the semis race!</p>

                     <p>7 Nov,2023 | Details</p>
                     <br/>
                     <p>What a game it has been! Glenn Maxwell played one of the greatest ODI innings we have ever witnessed, propelling Australia to secure their place in the semi-finals. With this victory, Australia becomes the third team to book a spot in the semis, leaving the other teams to battle it out for the remaining final spot. The 2023 ODI World Cup action continues on Wednesday, November 8 with England taking on the Netherlands in Pune. The match will commence at 2 pm IST (8.30 am GMT), and we will be here with our build-up much earlier. Until then, take care and goodbye!</p>

                            Yet another chapter was written into the story of subcontinental cricket's most engrossing rivalry, in which Bangladesh came away deserved winners against Sri Lanka, winning by three wickets and, crucially, 53 deliveries in Delhi. The margin of victory means Bangladesh have leapfrogged Sri Lanka on the points table on net run rate, while Bangladesh, Netherlands and Sri Lanka are all on four points and all three - and England - are still vying for the two remaining spots at the 2025 Champions Trophy.</p>

                          <p style="padding-top: 15px;">Ravindra Jadeja took 5 wickets as the fabled Indian bowling lineup ripped through the South African batters to bundle them out for 83 as the hosts won by a resounding 243 runs, keeping their unbeaten run intact.

                            Earlier, riding on Virat Kohli’s unbeaten 101 India put on 326 for 5 against South Africa at the Eden Gardens, celebrating his 35th birthday in the most befitting manner. Kohli reached the landmark when he scored a single off Kagiso Rabada in the 49th over of the Indian innings in front of a packed Eden Gardens crowds that kept chanting his names. Prior to the match against South Africa, Kohli narrowly missed out on his 49th ODI century during India’s match against Sri Lanka on Thursday at the Wankhede Stadium.</p>
